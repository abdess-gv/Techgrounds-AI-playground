**Current Campaign Assessment:**
Campaign: [CAMPAIGN_NAME]
Objective: [PRIMARY_GOAL]
Target audience: [DEMOGRAPHIC_PROFILE]
Budget: [TOTAL_SPEND]
Duration: [TIME_PERIOD]
Channels: [MARKETING_CHANNELS]

**Performance Metrics:**
- Reach: [IMPRESSIONS/VIEWS]
- Engagement: [CLICKS/INTERACTIONS]
- Conversion: [SALES/SIGNUPS]
- Cost efficiency: [CPA/ROAS]
- Audience feedback: [COMMENTS/REVIEWS]

</campaign-analysis-framework>

<systematic-improvement-process>

**Phase 1: Data Collection & Analysis**
Gather feedback from 5 sources:
1. **Quantitative Metrics:** CTR, conversion rates, engagement rates
2. **Customer Surveys:** Direct feedback from target audience (min 100 responses)
3. **Social Listening:** Comments, mentions, sentiment analysis
4. **Competitor Analysis:** What's working in your space
5. **Team Insights:** Internal observations and ideas

**Phase 2: Problem Identification**
Rank issues by impact and difficulty:
- üî¥ High Impact, Easy Fix (do immediately)
- üü° High Impact, Hard Fix (plan carefully)
- üü¢ Low Impact, Easy Fix (quick wins)
- ‚ö´ Low Impact, Hard Fix (ignore for now)

**Phase 3: Hypothesis-Driven Testing**
For each improvement, create:
- **Hypothesis:** "If we change [X], then [Y] will improve because [Z]"
- **Test Design:** A/B test with clear variables
- **Success Metrics:** Specific numbers that indicate improvement
- **Timeline:** Duration needed to gather significant data

**Phase 4: Implementation & Monitoring**
- Test one variable at a time for clear results
- Monitor daily for first week, then weekly
- Set automatic alerts for significant changes
- Document everything for future reference

For this problem: [PROBLEM_STATEMENT]

Use this systematic reasoning approach:

**Step 1: Problem Decomposition**
- What exactly is being asked?
- What are the key components or sub-problems?
- What information do I have, and what's missing?
- What assumptions might I need to make?

**Step 2: Analysis Framework**
- What analytical approach is most appropriate? (cause-effect, cost-benefit, risk-reward, etc.)
- What factors should I consider and prioritize?
- How do these factors interact with each other?
- What are the potential consequences of different approaches?

**Step 3: Solution Development**
- Generate 3-5 potential solutions
- For each solution, consider: feasibility, resources needed, timeline, risks
- What are the pros and cons of each approach?
- How would I test or validate each solution?

**Step 4: Decision Logic**
- What criteria should guide the final decision?
- How do the solutions perform against these criteria?
- What are the implementation steps for the chosen solution?
- What could go wrong, and how would I mitigate those risks?

**Step 5: Validation & Refinement**
- Does this solution address the original problem completely?
- Have I considered all stakeholders and their perspectives?
- What would need to happen for this solution to succeed?
- How would I measure success and adjust if needed?
