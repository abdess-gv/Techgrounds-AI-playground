# Final Review of Navbar.tsx Modifications

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the verification process for the changes made to `src/components/Navbar.tsx`. The goal was to add a new navigation link for "Prompt Engineering 2.0".

## 2. Verification Checks

The modified `src/components/Navbar.tsx` file was reviewed against the following criteria:

*   **Presence of the New Link:**
    *   **Finding:** The "Prompt Engineering 2.0" link is correctly added in both the desktop navigation section (visible on medium screens and up) and the mobile navigation section (visible when the menu is toggled open on smaller screens).
    *   **Status:** CONFIRMED.

*   **Correctness of the Link's Destination (`href`):**
    *   **Finding:** In both desktop and mobile sections, the new link correctly points to the path `/embed/prompt-engineering-2`.
    *   **Status:** CONFIRMED.

*   **Positioning of the New Link:**
    *   **Finding:** The "Prompt Engineering 2.0" link is positioned immediately after the "AI Quiz" link in both desktop and mobile navigation structures, as intended.
    *   **Status:** CONFIRMED.

*   **Styling Consistency:**
    *   **Finding:** The Tailwind CSS classes applied to the new link are identical to those used for other similar text-based navigation links (e.g., "AI Quiz", "Prompt Training") in both desktop and mobile views. This includes classes for text color, hover effects, font weight, padding (for mobile), and transition effects. The `onClick={() => setIsOpen(false)}` handler for closing the mobile menu is also correctly applied.
    *   **Status:** CONFIRMED.

*   **Integrity of Other Navbar Elements:**
    *   **Finding:** All other parts of the Navbar component, including other navigation links, the brand logo link, the mobile menu toggle mechanism, and general layout classes, appear to be unchanged and function as before. No unintentional alterations or breakages were observed.
    *   **Status:** CONFIRMED.
